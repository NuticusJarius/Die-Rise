### Step 3:
Four more symbols around the map need to be stepped on in a random order. This is solved through trial and error: one player at each symbol. The symbol is correct if it lights up; if it fails, all other symbols will reset.

#### Symbol locations:
In front of the elevator outside of spawn.\

### Step 4:
Grab a sniper rifle, and shoot the balls in both dragon mouths. The balls will disappear.

### Step 5:
The balls are now under the paw of the lion statues in the spawn room. Shoot each ball 20 times with the sliquifier. They should both be spinning.

### Step 6:
Have each player place down a Trample Steam on four different zombie symbols. The Trample Steam must be facing the pylon. Fireworks will go off if all four are placed correctly. Use the Trample Steams 16 times, this can be split among all four Trample Steams among all four players or done on one with one player, anyway that you prefer. They can be activated by a zombie or by a player.

#### Symbol locations:
Just outside the spawn room in front of the elevator.\

### Step 7:
The team will need to locate 8 Mahjong tiles, there are 11 locations they can be in. Four tiles represent a number, one, two three, and four, and four that represent a direction, north, south, east, and west. The pillars of the pylon need to be melee'd with the Galvelknuckles in a certain order. This order is determined by the tiles which will have matching colors that tell you the order a direction is punched. For example, if the tile indicating south is green and the tile indicating one is green then the southern pillar of the pylon is to be punched first. There is a tile right next to the pylon on the railing, that is where the north is. If the wrong order is input go to the next round to try again.\
