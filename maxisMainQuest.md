# Die Rise Maxis Main Quest Guide

## Recommended setup:
* Store enough points in the bank to open up the whole map on round 1

## Note:
* Buying the Galvelknuckles or Bowie knife bugs the game out
* Need four players
* Need to build the Trample Steam
* Need pack-a-punched ballistic knife
* Don't forget to do the Navcard table. It needs to be built to begin step 2.

## Steps

### Step 1:
Turn on power.

### Step 2:
Have each team member stand on four symbols on the top of elevators to get them to light up.

#### Symbol locations:
The first elevator right out of spawn.\

Elevator next to the mp5 wallbuy.\

### Step 3:
Four more symbols around the map need to be stepped on in a random order. This is solved through trial and error: one player at each symbol. The symbol is correct if it lights up; if it fails, all other symbols will reset.

#### Symbol locations:
In front of the elevator outside of spawn.\

### Step 4:
Grab a sniper rifle, and shoot the balls in both dragon mouths. The balls will disappear.

### Step 5:
Kill zombies in the Buddha room until Maxis says a special quote. Shoot the ballistic knife anywhere in the room, shoot a zombie with the ballistic knife in the room. This step is very buggy, once it is done you can have Galvelknuckles or a Bowie knife. Maxis will have a quote if done properly.

### Step 6:
Have each player place down a Trample Steam on four different lion symbols. The Trample Steam must be facing the same direction the lion head is pointing towards. It will be in the right position if you cannot pick up the Trample Steam. Two players must go into the spawn room and pick up the balls that are under the paw of both lion statues. Place one ball on the trample steam in the spawn room and the other on the Trample Steam at the bottom of the escalator. The balls will bounce between the buildings.

#### Symbol locations:

### Step 7:
The team will need to locate 8 Mahjong tiles, there are 11 locations they can be in. Four tiles represent a number, one, two three, and four, and four that represent a direction, north, south, east, and west. The pillars of the pylon need to be melee'd with the Galvelknuckles in a certain order. This order is determined by the tiles which will have matching colors that tell you the order a direction is punched. For example, if the tile indicating south is green and the tile indicating one is green then the southern pillar of the pylon is to be punched first. There is a tile right next to the pylon on the railing, that is where the north is. If the wrong order is input go to the next round to try again.\
